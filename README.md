#Input files (will add)

## Structure Constant calculation

### construction of k-mesh in k space
    

### Transformation from symmetry to rectangular cords
    unsure what this is doing 

### alpha calculation???

### convergence functions

### factorial calculation
    Currently having an issue with this!

    
```bash
gfortran -lgfortran -o factorial factorial.F
```
    
```bash
./factorial
```
### cross product
    working test script 

### generate vectors of direct and real space

### final calculation of structure constant matrix 

There are currently three files:

### spherical:

describe spherical harmonic function





## LMTO

## Cannonical bands
